# Cells Image Classification us√¨ng CNN
This project aims to classify electron microscope images of cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our goal is to accurately classify cell types into eight different predefined classes, leveraging a dataset of 15,092 images. The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab, using its GPU.
